<b>ASPPatterns.Chap4.DomainModel.Model:</b>

The Domain Model project will contain all of the business logic within the application. Domain objects will live in here and will have relation-
ships to other objects to represent the banking domain the application is built around. The project will also define contracts in the form of interfaces for domain object persistence and
retrieval; the Repository pattern will be employed for all persistence management needs. (The Repository pattern is discussed in greater detail in Chapter 7.) The Model project will not
have a reference to any other project ensuring, it remains free of any infrastructure concernsand focuses squarely on the business domain

ASPPatterns.Chap4.DomainModel.Repository:

The Repository project will contain implementations of the repository interfaces defined in the Model project. The Repository has a reference to the Model project in order to 
hydrate domain objects from the database as well as to persist. The Repository project is concerned only with the responsibility of domain object persistence and retrieval.

ASPPatterns.Chap4.DomainModel.AppService:
The AppService project will act as the gateway into the application—the API if you will. The presentation layer will communicate with
the AppService via messages, which are simple data transfer objects. The messaging patterns are covered in detail in Chapter 7. The AppService layer will also define view models, which
are flattened views of the domain model used solely for the displaying of data. Chapter 8 covers this topic in greater detail.

ASPPatterns.Chap4.DomainModel.UI.Web:
The UI.Web project is responsible for the presentation and use experience needs of the application. This project talks only to the AppService and receives strongly typed view models 
that have been created specifically for the views of the user experience.
